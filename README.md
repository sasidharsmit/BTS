This is a simple Python webserver that hosts a search engine. 

There are 2 key components to this server:
1. master.py - that runs the webserver and triggers the backend 
2. querier.py - the backend script that is responsible for the data returned

Usage:
-----

Step 1: 
------

Run the below command in your terminal

python master.py


Step 2: 
------

Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser


Step 3:
------

Enter your search term in the text box and click on the "Search" button

Note:
I haven't had much time to work on it. So, there's not a lot of error handling done on this (not to mention some poor coding practice). But, this works for my purpose. Please feel free to clone this one and use it, if it helps you.
