Early years[edit]
In 1970 when Amazon was founded by Rosina Richter Christy and Julie Morse Quist, it was far from a full-fledged bookstore. The books were kept in the front room of the women's collective they lived in and books were only available from 3 to 6 PM or by special arrangement.[2][3][4] This arrangement lasted for about two years before the book store moved to Minneapolis' Lesbian Resource Center and then migrated through a series of different storefront addresses. Working conditions were sometimes difficult and included an unsafe neighborhood and a building with no heat where pipes froze and people had to wear gloves inside the store.[3][4]
Lawsuit[edit]
In 1999, the cooperative sued Amazon.com for trademark infringement. After sometimes acrimonious legal proceedings, the case was settled in November of that year, with the cooperative signing over its rights of the name Amazon to Amazon.com, and Amazon.com then licensing the use of the name back to the cooperative.[5][6]
True Colors[edit]

Influence and significance[edit]
Amazon became "the oldest independent feminist bookstore in North America"[11] and was probably "the oldest in the English speaking world".[3] It had an impact that extended both beyond its immediate area and beyond the United States.[12]
It also had a presence in popular culture. Cartoonist and graphic novelist Alison Bechdel was inspired to create the fictional Madwimmin Books in Dykes to Watch Out For based on experiences at the store.[13]
