ablet (taiblet in Scots[1][2][3]) is a medium-hard, sugary confection from Scotland. Tablet is usually made from sugar, condensed milk, and butter, which is boiled to a soft-ball stage and allowed to crystallise. It is often flavoured with vanilla or whisky, and sometimes has nut pieces in it.[2][4]
Tablet differs from fudge in that it has a brittle, grainy texture, where fudge is much softer. Well-made tablet is a medium-hard confection, not as soft as fudge, but not as hard as hard candy.
Commercially available tablet often uses fondant instead of the milk products. This produces a slightly less granular texture compared to the traditional home-made tablet, and is supposedly much easier to prepare on a commercial scale.[citation needed]

History[edit]
According to The Scots Kitchen[page needed] by F. Marian McNeill, tablet is first noted in The Household Book of Lady Grisell Baillie in the early 18th century.[5] The traditional recipe uses just sugar and cream. More modern recipes substitute condensed milk and butter for the cream, as it has a tendency to burn when boiled.
Names[edit]
Tablet is sometimes referred to as Swiss Milk tablet (Swiss Milk being a term used by some for condensed milk)[6][7][8] or butter tablet.
Similar confections[edit]
Tablet is almost identical to Québécois sucre à la crème. It's also reportedly similar to South American tableta de leche. Another close relative can be found in the Netherlands called borstplaat, eaten during the time that Sinterklaas is celebrated. A similar sweet, often with nuts or raisins added, is known as kiri aluwa or "milk toffee" in Sri Lanka.[citation needed]
