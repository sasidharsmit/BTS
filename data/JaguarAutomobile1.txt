Jaguar entered a new era in 2013, when it launched the F-Type and revived the sporty and innovative spirit it had lost in recent decades. The British company made another step into the future in 2015, when the F-Pace became the first SUV to wear the iconic "Cat" logo. Come 2016 and Jaguar is ready to take a new step into the future, this time with an all-electric vehicle. It’s called the I-Pace, it’s only a concept for now, but will become a production model for the 2018 model year.

Unveiled at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, the I-Pace is loosely based on the F-Pace styling-wise, but ditches Jaguar’s already familiar four-cylinder, V-6, and V-8 powerplants for a pair of electric motors and a battery pack. The I-Pace will become Jaguar’s first-ever electric vehicle when it hits public roads and will essentially bring to fruition the electrification process that the company began back in 2010 with the C-X75 concept.

The I-Pace was created and developed by Ian Callum, Jaguar’s design director and the man who has previously penned cars such as the Aston Martin DB7 and DB9, Jaguar XK, XF, and XJ, as well as the F-Type sports car. Callum also designed the Ford RS200 and Nissan R390 race cars.

Described as a smart five-seater that’s "a performance car, a family car, and an SUV all in one," the I-Pace grants Jaguar entry to the electric car segment, and if performance figures are any indication, the popular Tesla Model X will finally get a worthy competitor.

Updated 03/15/2017: Jaguar dropped a series of new images showing the I-Pace concept in action on the streets of London. Also the company confirmed that the I-Pace will sprint from 0 to 60 mph in just 4 seconds and will have a driving range of about 500 kilometers.
